# Running App

An app to track your runs offline. Created with React Native and Typescript, as of yet not optinmized to work on iOS. 

The runs are stored with the React Native Async storage module. 

The app tracks the distance, speed and elevation of your runs and lets you visualize single runs in these three dimensions as well as your run history. 
You can download your runs as GPX files to visualize and trace them on a map.
